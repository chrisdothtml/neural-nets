# wine-quality

> Predicting the quality of a wine based on the various input parameters (see [data info](./data/winequality.names) for more)

## Notes

This one didn't turn out to predict very accurately, and it's not something like a color classifier that I can easily tweak with intuitive feedback to improve.
